March 22 2024:	
	- When the administrator updates the restaurant name to a new one, the function I've created automatically deletes the parent directory of the old restaurant name and replaces it with the new restaurant name in the directory path. This ensures consistency throughout the project. For example, "public/images/restaurant/<oldRestaurantName>/banner/" will be replaced with "public/images/restaurant/<newRestaurantName>/banner/".

	- Fixing the bugs caused by the creation of a new directory each time an admin updates the name and banner image of a restaurant.

March 24 2024:	
	- When a restaurant updates its name, the corresponding banner image directory is replaced with the new one, leading to space savings. For example, if the current path is '/burgerbarn/banner/burgersmash.jpg' and the administrator changes the restaurant's name and image to '/tokyoterrace/banner/tokyofood.png', this enhancement ensures a more upscale and space-efficient system..
	- Admin can see the existing banner image and new updated image in update restaurant page.

Problems:

	- When you delete a specific category then what will happen to the products associates with it?
